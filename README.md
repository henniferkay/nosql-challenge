# nosql-challenge

## Background
As requested by the editors of a food magazine, 'Eat Safe, Love,' data from the UK Food Standards Agency were retrieved and analyzed using MongoDB, a non-SQL database program.

## Methods
There were two parts to this project. First, `NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb` loaded data that were originally stored in a JSON file and updated the database with a new restaurant called "Penang Flavours." In the other Notebook `NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb`, the updated data were analyzed to find the establishments with high ratings and low hygiene scores. The data were queried and converted into DataFrames to answer the following questions: \
    1. Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20? \
    2. Which establishments in London have a rating value greater than or equal to 4? \
    3. What are the top 5 establishments with a rating value of 5? \
    4. How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0?
